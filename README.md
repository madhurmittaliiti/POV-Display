# POV-Display
A Persistence of Vision (POV) Display project developed by the Electronics Club.  The system uses a rotating array of LEDs controlled by a microcontroller to display text and patterns in mid-air based on the persistence of vision phenomenon of the human eye.   
# ✨ POV Display — Electronics Club

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Persistence of Vision (POV) Display**, a device that creates floating text and images in mid-air using a rapidly rotating strip of 8 LEDs.
It is based on the persistence of vision phenomenon, where the human eye retains an image for a short duration, allowing discrete light patterns to appear as a continuous display.

Developed under the **Electronics Club**, this project demonstrates the integration of electronics and mechanical design.

## 🧠 Working Principle

When LEDs mounted on a rotating arm blink in a precise sequence at high speed, the human eye perceives a stable image or text in air.
A microcontroller synchronizes LED patterns with rotation speed to render characters and graphics.
